#surveyProject in R

## The custom-made script for this class project was created to analyze data from a long term rodent study collected from 1977 to 2002. Citation for the paper and data collected from this resource is below:

## The goal of this class project was to compare the species of genus Reithrodontomys, and how these species could be interacting and competing with each other. The variables tested are species, year, sex, length, and weight in R Studio. Three figures and a statistical test were used to help answer this main question.

## Figures and statistical descriptions

1) Is there a relationship between species and weight? This question was answered by using a boxplot (PDF file: swBoxplot). The same question was answered by using a statistical test, ANOVA. 
2) Is there a difference between species counts by year? This question was answered by using a line graph (PDF file: syLine). 
3) How does the female distribution change over time for R. megalotis (species Id = RM)? This question was answered by using a histogram (PDF file: RMfemaleHistogram).
